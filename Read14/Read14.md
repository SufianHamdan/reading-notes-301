# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

**What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?**
The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.These early personal computers weren't much more than toys. You could play pong or simple shooting games, maybe do some word processing. And these toys were marketed almost entirely to men and boys.

**Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?**

**What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?**

1. some companies has males more than females
2. some companies has females more than males
3. some companies has diversity of males and females

**When are diversity efforts most successful?**
when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders.

**Why do diverse companies perform better?**
Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes. In a 2011 study of diversity in the top firms in Standard & Poor's Composite 1500 list, researchers found “female representation in top management leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value.”

**Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.**
When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups. When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.

When Tracy Chou of Pinterest shared the company’s demographic information last year, she explained: "We only stand to improve the quality and impact of our products if the people building them are representative of the user base and reflect the same diversity of demography, culture, life experiences and interests that makes our community so vibrant."

Walker & Company CEO Tristan Walker recently observed: "If more black people were building features or striking partnerships at Twitter, perhaps they’d have a great idea" for more effectively engaging black users.
